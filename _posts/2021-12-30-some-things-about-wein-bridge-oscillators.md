*"He’s coming. I gotta do something quick. Okay, I’ll make thoughtful gestures and act like I’m thinking. "*

*“I only look more depressed and stupid. Is he going to take a peek of my paper now? Can’t be seen playing tic-tac-toe **alone** in exam papers. I should have studied. He’s looking. Shit! I gotta write something:- Wein bridge oscillator is an electronic device ………”*

It is funny when you’re sitting in the examination hall totally unprepared, not knowing a word to write and the head teacher of your department comes in the exam hall and walks right past your bench. I’m not sure if you have experienced such, but people, I fought the greatest battle with my sanity when it happened to me the *first* time. Needless to say, I won, using my excellent acting and rare ability to handle pressure with ease. He walks away unnoticed of my plight thus saving me from being spotted as the spoiled brat of the class, again.

Folks, when you are that unprepared, it is hard to tell if the paper is easy or *not easy*. You scan the question paper from top to bottom, try to run a google search on your brain and you still won’t have a clue if drawing the circuit diagram of the Wein bridge oscillator was amongst the easy and repetitive one or from the Halley's comet questions set. At that point, you will have only one way to find out. Look around and observe how others are doing.


So, you start rolling your head around. Friends who had showed up at your dorm room earlier, whining about how they had not even started on a single chapter are moving their hands so fast that they would qualify a kung-fu competition with that speed, let alone the exam. You confirm, the questions are easy and most of your friends are going to pass. You feel even more depressed thinking none of your friends will be around to take the paper next time in “back” exam. You always want your friends around in the exam hall even when they’re lying pricks.

As time passes, you learn from your mistakes and will start making real progress, not on study, but on handling situations with utmost calmness when you haven’t studied. Next time you haven’t written a word, and the head teacher passes by, you won’t freeze with fright, but instead bestow him with a very suave good morning wish and also ask him to send your regards to madam when he is home.
