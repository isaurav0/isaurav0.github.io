Hey, I'm Saurav. If you really wanna hear about it, the first thing you want to know is I'm a computer engineering student studying at IOE, WRC, Pokhara. I am a noob web developer getting my hands dirty with JavaScript and Python.    
  
I love strumming few chords in guitar and ukulele in my spare time. I am very fond of dribbling football and basketball every once in a while.
