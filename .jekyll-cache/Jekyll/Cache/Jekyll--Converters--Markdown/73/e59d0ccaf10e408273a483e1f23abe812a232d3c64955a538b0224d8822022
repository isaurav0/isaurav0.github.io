<p><em>â€œI only look more depressed and stupid. Is he going to take a peek at my paper now? Canâ€™t be seen playing tic-tac-toe <strong>alone</strong> in exam papers. I should have studied. Heâ€™s looking. Shit! I gotta write something:- Wein-bridge oscillator is an electronic device â€¦â€¦â€¦â€</em></p>

<p>It is funny when youâ€™re sitting in the examination hall totally unprepared, not knowing a word to write and the head teacher of your department comes in the exam hall and walks right past your bench. Iâ€™m not sure if you have experienced such, but people, I fought the greatest battle with my sanity when it happened to me the <em>first</em> time. Needless to say, I won, using my excellent acting and rare ability to handle pressure with ease. He walks away unnoticed of my plight thus saving me from being spotted as the spoiled brat of the class, again.</p>

<p>Folks, when you are that unprepared, it is hard to tell if the paper is easy or <strong>not easy</strong>. You scan the question paper from top to bottom, try to run a google search on your brain and you still wonâ€™t have a clue if drawing the circuit diagram of the wein-bridge oscillator was amongst the easy and repetitive one or from the Halleyâ€™s comet questions set. At that point, you will have only one way to find out. Look around and observe.</p>

<p>So, you start looking around. Friends who had come to your dorm room earlier that morning, whining about how they had not even started on a single chapter are writing by moving their hands so fast that they would qualify a kung-fu competition with that speed, let alone a simple exam. You confirm, the questions are easy and most of your friends are going to pass. You feel even more depressed thinking none of your friends will be around to take the paper next time in â€œbackâ€ exam. You always want your friends around in the exam hall even when theyâ€™re lying pricks.</p>

<p>However, as time passes, if you work hard and learn from your mistakes, you will start making real progress, not on study, but on staying calm when you havenâ€™t studied. When you havenâ€™t written a word, and the head teacher passes by, you wonâ€™t freeze with fright, but instead bestow him with a very sauve wish of good morning and also ask him to send your regards to madam when he is home.</p>
