I"i<p>DNS stands for Domain Name System, which is basically a method of assigning cute nicknames to ugly IP addresses.
Every devices on network has their IP addresses. I dont want to talk about IP addresses in detail in this blog, however 
IP addresses distinguish devices on the network. Suppose we want to browse facebook, what we are normally doing is
making some https requests to facebook’s server. And to make request to facebook’s server, we need to know the server’s IP address. 
It is a pain in somewhere to remember a numerical jargon like 192.168.10.33. This is where the great DNS comes to rescue.</p>
