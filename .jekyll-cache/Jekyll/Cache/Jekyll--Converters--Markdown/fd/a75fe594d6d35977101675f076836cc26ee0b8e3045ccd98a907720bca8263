I"Ÿ<p>I have been singing since I can remember. Though I am a mediocre singer, my love for music has only grown with time. I taught myself to play harmonium when I was 12 years old. It was an instant love with the instrument. Over these most recent years, I learnt guitar, piano and ukulele. Iâ€™m no magician in any of these instruments either. You could call me a Jack of all trades and <strong>Saurav</strong>.</p>
