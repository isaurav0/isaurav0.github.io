I"ú<p>A wise man once said, â€œTo access your server anytime, you gotta keep it running all the time.â€ You canâ€™t make use of shell if you use the shell to run your server. It is of no issue during development because you are on your local computer. You have GUI. You can 
start a new tab anytime you want and do your stuffs. But during the stage of deployment, it can be a mess. 
We generally SSH to a VM from command line. We start the server. It starts. We want to keep it running. So we cannot Ctrl+C.
All we are left to do by then is to stare at the black screen while we question about every life choices we made and try hard not to break down. 
Furthermore, servers need to withstand system failures, reboots, server crash and what not for stability.</p>
